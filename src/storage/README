There are 3 commands you need to know once PostgreSQL is installed:

* `sudo service postgresql status` for checking the status of your database.
* `sudo service postgresql start` to start running your database.
* `sudo service postgresql stop` to stop running your database.

Connect to database `sudo -u postgres psql`
